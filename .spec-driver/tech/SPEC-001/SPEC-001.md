## 1. Intent & Summary

- **Scope / Boundaries**: The complete figma-fetch system — from CLI invocation through Figma API interaction, normalization, and artifact output. Excludes MCP wrapper, OAuth, write-back to Figma, and full file-level token/style inventory.
- **Value Signals**: An agent can implement a typical UI frame from the output artifacts without needing raw Figma JSON.
- **Guiding Principles**: Normalization is the product. Library-first. Heuristics as pure functions. Compact over exhaustive.
- **Change History**: Initial spec from DE-001. Patch-01: auth/client split, heuristic catalogue transcribed, caching promoted to FR, error hierarchy FR added, token scope clarified, outline XML vocabulary defined, opacity deduplicated, traceability matrix added.

## 2. Stakeholders & Journeys

- **Systems / Integrations**:
  - Figma REST API v1 (`/v1/files/:key/nodes`, `/v1/images/:key`)
  - Local filesystem for artifact output and cache
- **Primary Journeys / Flows**:
  1. CLI receives Figma URL + token + options
  2. URL parser extracts fileKey + nodeId
  3. Auth module builds headers
  4. Client fetches node JSON + PNG in parallel
  5. Normalizer transforms raw JSON → normalized tree
  6. Token aggregator collects encountered references
  7. Outline generator produces JSON + XML outlines
  8. Output pipeline writes artifact bundle
- **Edge Cases & Non-goals**: See PROD-001 §2. Additionally: full file-level variable inventory (requires Variables API / Enterprise access) is explicitly out of scope.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: `figma/url.ts` MUST parse Figma URLs into `{ fileKey, nodeId, originalUrl }`, converting node IDs from URL format (`123-456`) to API format (`123:456`). Invalid URLs MUST throw typed `FigmaUrlParseError`.

- **FR-002**: `figma/auth.ts` MUST provide an authentication module with the contract `{ token: string; header(): Record<string, string> }` that produces `X-Figma-Token` headers. The module MUST be designed so OAuth support can be added later without changing consumer code.

- **FR-003**: `figma/client.ts` MUST send authenticated requests to the Figma REST API with configurable depth, geometry, and plugin data options. Failed requests MUST be retried with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts). Rate limit responses (429) MUST trigger backoff. The client MUST use the auth module (FR-002) for header injection.

- **FR-004**: `figma/fetch-image.ts` MUST export PNG at scale=2 by default. SVG export MUST be available via option. Render failure MUST NOT block the pipeline — failure is recorded in manifest.

- **FR-005**: `normalize/classify.ts` MUST map raw Figma node types to the `NormalizedNodeType` enum: `document`, `page`, `frame`, `group`, `component`, `instance`, `variant-set`, `text`, `shape`, `vector`, `image`, `line`, `boolean-operation`, `mask`, `section`, `unknown`.

- **FR-006**: `normalize/node.ts`, `layout.ts`, `style.ts`, `text.ts` MUST transform raw Figma JSON into `NormalizedNode` trees. Layout MUST normalize to mode/sizing/alignment/padding/gap/wrap/constraints/position/clip. Appearance MUST normalize fills, strokes, effects, corner radius. Opacity MUST be represented only in `NormalizedAppearance`, not duplicated at the node level. Text MUST normalize content, style, color, token refs, semantic kind, truncation.

- **FR-007**: `normalize/heuristics.ts` MUST infer `NormalizedRole` from node properties. Inference MUST be conservative — `unknown` over overconfident guesses. Each heuristic MUST be an isolated pure function. The following heuristic rules MUST be implemented:

  1. **Container detection**: A node is likely a container if it is a frame/group/component/instance with children, has nontrivial bounds, and has layout or padding properties present.

  2. **Stack detection**: A node is likely a stack if auto layout exists, children are arranged along one axis, and gap/padding properties are meaningful.

  3. **Text semantic inference**: Infer from font size, font weight, node name, text length, and parent context. Large bold short text near top of parent → heading. Small text adjacent to field → label. Text inside button-like instance → button label.

  4. **Button-like detection**: Signals: instance/component/frame with one short text child, fixed or hug sizing, padded auto-layout, visible fill, name contains button/cta/primary/secondary.

  5. **Input-like detection**: Signals: label + text region + border/fill, rectangular container, width > height, names like input/field/search/email/password.

  6. **Icon detection**: Signals: small vector group, square-ish bounds, no text, simple naming.

  7. **Export-worthy asset detection**: Signals: image fills, many vector descendants, masks, illustration-like names, complex boolean operations.

  8. **Noise reduction**: De-emphasize invisible nodes (unless structurally important), zero-size nodes, decorative micro-layers, deeply nested wrappers with no distinct style/layout semantics. Mark as low-priority in diagnostics rather than deleting from output.

- **FR-008**: `normalize/variables.ts` MUST extract `boundVariables` and `explicitVariableModes` from node JSON, mapping them to `NormalizedVariableBindings` with resolved token names where available. Both literal value and token reference MUST be surfaced. This is per-node extraction only — file-level variable inventory is out of scope.

- **FR-009**: `util/cache.ts` MUST implement file-based caching under `.cache/figma-fetch`. Cache key MUST include: file key, node ID, requested depth, version (if pinned), and relevant fetch flags. Caching is a day-one requirement. Cache MUST be wrapping Figma client calls.

- **FR-010**: `normalize/components.ts` MUST extract component/instance metadata including componentId, componentName, componentSetId, variant properties, property references, and reusability assessment.

- **FR-011**: `normalize/assets.ts` MUST classify nodes as likely assets based on: image fills, vector complexity, naming patterns, boolean operations. MUST produce export suggestions with reason strings.

- **FR-012**: `normalize/tokens-used.ts` MUST aggregate variable and style references encountered during normalization of the selected subtree into a `tokens-used.json` artifact. The artifact MUST include: scope metadata (`fileKey`, `rootNodeId`, `isFullInventory: false`), deduplicated variable references (token ID, name (nullable), collection ID, resolved type, encountered-on locations), style references (type, ID, name, encountered-on locations), and a count summary by category. Fields unresolvable without the Variables API MUST accept null.

- **FR-013**: `normalize/outline.ts` MUST generate JSON and XML outlines from normalized trees. XML MUST use the following element vocabulary mapping `NormalizedNodeType` to element names:

  | NormalizedNodeType | XML Element |
  | --- | --- |
  | `frame` | `<frame>` |
  | `group` | `<group>` |
  | `component` | `<component>` |
  | `instance` | `<instance>` |
  | `variant-set` | `<variant-set>` |
  | `text` | `<text>` |
  | `shape` | `<shape>` |
  | `vector` | `<vector>` |
  | `image` | `<image>` |
  | `line` | `<line>` |
  | `boolean-operation` | `<boolean-op>` |
  | `mask` | `<mask>` |
  | `section` | `<section>` |
  | `document` | `<document>` |
  | `page` | `<page>` |
  | `unknown` | `<node>` |

  Required attributes on every element: `id`, `name`. Optional attributes: `role` (if not null/unknown), `w` (width), `h` (height), `visible` (only when false). Self-closing for leaf nodes.

- **FR-014**: `output/context-md.ts` MUST generate `context.md` with sections: source metadata, visual reference, structural summary, important children, tokens used, assets, implementation notes.

- **FR-015**: `output/write.ts` MUST create the artifact directory structure (`visual/`, `structure/`, `tokens/`, `assets/`, `logs/`) and write all artifacts. `output/manifest.ts` MUST generate `manifest.json` describing all produced artifacts. The `tokens/` directory contains `tokens-used.json` only.

- **FR-016**: `errors.ts` MUST define a typed error hierarchy: `FigmaUrlParseError`, `FigmaAuthError`, `FigmaNotFoundError`, `FigmaRateLimitError`, `FigmaRenderError`, `NormalizationError`. Each error MUST carry actionable context (message, cause, relevant IDs). Partial failures MUST preserve best-effort output with diagnostics.

- **FR-017**: Selective expansion MUST evaluate configurable expansion triggers with documented default thresholds after initial normalization. Triggers: child count exceeding configurable threshold, incomplete layout container children, text nodes needing deeper inspection, component instances needing referenced component metadata, vector/icon nodes needing export data, image fills needing extraction, incomplete variable binding context. Default thresholds MUST be documented and overridable via configuration. The system MUST refetch specific child nodes and merge expanded data into the normalized tree.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NF-001**: Normalized output MUST be >50% smaller than raw input in token count for typical frames.

- **NF-002**: All normalization heuristics MUST be implemented as isolated pure functions with unit tests. Fixture-driven testing for representative UI patterns.

- **NF-003**: Output MUST be deterministic — identical inputs produce identical byte-for-byte output.

- **NF-004**: System MUST be structured as a library + CLI, not a single script. Core logic MUST be importable for future MCP wrapper. Minimal dependencies: TypeScript, Zod, native fetch/undici, commander/yargs, p-limit, vitest.

### Operational Targets

- **Maintainability**: Each normalization module testable independently. Assembly tested via golden fixtures.

## 4. Solution Outline

### Architecture

```
CLI (cli.ts)
  │
  ├─ URL Parser (figma/url.ts)
  ├─ Auth (figma/auth.ts)           ← FR-002: swappable auth module

```

### Data Flow

1. `cli.ts` parses args, calls `figma/url.ts` to parse URL
2. `figma/auth.ts` builds auth headers
3. `util/cache.ts` wraps `figma/client.ts` — fetches node JSON + image in parallel
4. `normalize/index.ts` orchestrates the normalization pipeline
5. `normalize/tokens-used.ts` aggregates encountered token references
6. `normalize/outline.ts` generates outlines from normalized tree
7. `output/` writes everything to disk with manifest

### Key Types

All types defined in `schemas/` using Zod:
- `schemas/raw.ts` — raw Figma API response shapes
- `schemas/normalized.ts` — `NormalizedNode` and sub-types (opacity in appearance only)
- `schemas/outline.ts` — `OutlineNode` shape
- `schemas/tokens-used.ts` — `TokensUsed` shape
- `schemas/manifest.ts` — `Manifest` shape

## 5. Behaviour & Scenarios

- **Primary Flow**: See §4 Data Flow
- **Error Handling**: See FR-016. Render failure → continue with warning in manifest. Partial normalization failure → preserve parent, record diagnostics on failed subtree.
- **Selective Expansion**: After initial depth-2 fetch, normalizer evaluates configurable triggers (FR-017). If triggered, client refetches specific children. Normalizer merges expanded nodes into tree.

## 6. Quality & Verification

- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit: each normalize module independently, each heuristic function, each error type
  - Fixture: raw JSON fixtures for representative UI patterns
  - Golden: input → expected normalized JSON + outline XML + context.md + tokens-used.json
  - Integration: full pipeline from raw JSON to artifact bundle
  - See [SPEC-001.tests](./SPEC-001.tests.md) for detailed testing guide
- **Verification Coverage**: Populated per-delta as implementation proceeds

## 7. Backlog Hooks & Dependencies

- **Related Specs / PROD**: Implements PROD-001
- **Risks & Mitigations**:
  - Figma API rate limiting → caching (FR-009) + p-limit concurrency
  - Heuristic drift → conservative defaults + confidence scoring
- **Known Gaps**:
  - MCP wrapper deferred
  - OAuth deferred
  - Full file-level variable inventory (Variables API, Enterprise access) deferred
  - Full file-level style inventory deferred
